			I've decided to make this game and all the source code open source. You are welcome to edit it and add in your own specifications.
			I'm open to collaborate with anyone who got some HTML5 Canvas knowledge or good in graphics design.

		<p>
			This a very early build (Prototype) of the game to give you an idea of what is going on (There might be errors).....<br/><br/>
			I haven't had enough time to work on the game lately coz of school and all that, but after exams I'll be all over it.
			Maybe even start another game.
		</p>

		<p>
			More features will be added to make the game more fun and more difficult.
		</p>
